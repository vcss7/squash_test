## The Usual Git Workflow

Micro-Committing is the practice of frequently committing the changes made in a
repository.

This has the benefits of:
1. Saving small changes
1. Keeping track of what is done in a work session (through the use of good 
   commit messages)
1. Breaking down big changes into smaller changes
1. Helping others see the changes that are occuring within the repository

The biggest negative is that, over the long term, the resulting git history is
long and hard to read where major changes were made in the repository.

The solution? **git squash!**
